From starting I had lot of doubts, so I was continuously using the tutoring services and ta office hours 
to clarify doubts and I used to have issue with pointers and later due to that I faced a problem in linked list 
I understood the concept of linked list. 

The new node is always added before the head of the given linked list and newly added node becomes the new head of 
the linked list so if we add an item at front, then this is also same as push where push function receive a pointer 
to the head pointer because function push must change the head pointer to point to new node so the time complexity 
for linked list insertion  and deletion is o(1) but in pulling up the value or if we want to find any value then the 
time complexity is o(n) because it has to iterate through all node in order to reach because the next value address is 
stored in previous link node.   


In midterm also I faced same issue with the linked list.
